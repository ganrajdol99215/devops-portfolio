# CI/CD Pipeline – Render + GitHub (Used in Your Portfolio Project)
##  Overview:

This portfolio project is deployed on Render, with continuous deployment (CD) connected to a GitHub repository. Whenever code is pushed to main, the site auto-builds and deploys via Render’s built-in CI/CD integration.
---
## Node.js CI/CD Project

Inside the `devops-cicd-node` folder, you'll find a **sample Node.js application**:

- `index.js` – Simple Node.js server
- `package.json` – Project metadata and dependencies

###  Features Demonstrated

 **Continuous Integration (CI):**
- Automated testing and build pipelines via **GitHub Actions**

 **Continuous Deployment (CD):**
- Automatic deployments to cloud platforms (**Render**)

"I hosted my portfolio on Render using its automatic CI/CD integration with GitHub. Each push to the main branch triggers a build, dependency install, and deploys the latest version. I follow semantic commits, use static linting (eslint), and keep the build lean with optimized assets. The result is an automated, scalable workflow without manual deployment."
